/*
1. `StrictMode` is a tool for **highlighting potential problems** in a React app.
  - It doesn't render anything visible, but helps with warnings during development (e.g., detecting unsafe lifecycle methods, deprecated APIs, etc.).
2. This line imports the createRoot function from the react-dom/client package.
  - Itâ€™s part of the React 18+ API used for creating a root DOM node for rendering your React components.
3. Our app is wrapped withh strictmode so that React can check for potential problems during development.
